# Sensor Data Model

This model directory contains a System Designer project that defines the Sensor data types and QoS.
    - Modules are used to group related elements and to provide namespaces which avoids naming conflicts.
    - Typedefs are used with primitive types to make the model more explicit when setting attribute types.
    - Constants define the lengths of MIN, MED and MAX strings.
    - Constants define Topic Names. These can be used when creating topics programatically.
    - Constants define QoS libraries and profiles. These can be used when setting QoS libraries and profiles programatically.
