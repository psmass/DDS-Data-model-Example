# Sensor Examples
The purpose of these examples is to demonstrate some data and QoS modeling best practices.

The Sensors directory conatins three example implementations of a simple Sensor model.
- C++11 (modern C++) w/XML Application Creation & Dynamic Data
- C++ (Traditional C++) with Programatic Entity creation with generated and compiled typed data (non-XML Application Creation)
- Python API - Connext Professional 7.0.x has a python API and a python generator which generates python code from IDL or XML data type definitions.

See model/README.md for more information about the data model, Quality of Service and best practices.
