# C++ example using code generation

## Environment

* MacOS Darwin (x64)
* Connext DDS Professional 6.1.0 

## Building Debug executable:



## Running Example:
Device and Controller must be executed from the build directory.

## ToDo:

- Check how to load an Dynamic data value enum (currently casting)
- Use and load an array of octets for deviceID
- Set Static Topic Values in Constructor vs. top of the handler
- Set deviceID Filter programatically so that xml is not unique per Partipant
- Set deviceID via "EPROM" struct vs. hardwire
